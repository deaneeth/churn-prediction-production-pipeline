# This module provides functionality to split a dataset into training and testing sets.
# It includes an implementation for a simple random split.
# The module is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy addition of new splitting strategies as needed
# It integrates with the overall data processing pipeline to ensure that data is appropriately split for model training

# This splitter can be extended with additional strategies like StratifiedSplitter as needed.
# The difference between simple and stratified is that simple randomly splits the data into train and test sets, while stratified ensures that the proportion of classes in the target variable is maintained in both the train and test sets.
